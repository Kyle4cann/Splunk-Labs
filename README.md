# Splunk Labs 1 â€“ Step-by-Step Guide

### Introduction:
This hands-on lab is designed to walk through a complete setup and integration of Splunk within a cloud-based environment. By leveraging AWS infrastructure and Ubuntu, the lab demonstrates how to install, configure, and utilize Splunk Enterprise for real-time data indexing, analysis, and visualization. It also covers the configuration of a universal forwarder and integration with AWS S3 buckets for extended data onboarding capabilities.

### Objectives:
To create an AWS instance, install Splunk on Ubuntu, configure Splunk users, index and search static data, use SPL (Splunk Processing Language), install and configure a universal forwarder, and integrate AWS S3 bucket data with Splunk.

## Part 1: Create an AWS Account and Instance

### Step 1. 
- Open https://aws.amazon.com/console/ in your browser
- Click on the account and the AWS management console

### Part 5: SPL (Splunk Processing Language)
SPL: Splunk Processing Language is used to search and retrieve stored data (Playing around with Fields and creating Visualization)
### Step 1. Adding to the Index
- Under Search type `index= index` name eg `index="_internal"`
- Add Host IP
- Add Source (Matrix)
- Add Source Type (Splunkd)
### Step 2. Modify timestamp
This enhances searching 
- Earliest Field `(earliest= -15m@m)`, this means that I want to search data for the first 15 minutes
- Latest Field `(latest= -1m@m)` Mean search data for last minute
### Step 3. Graphs
- Stats convert to Table
- Chart Convert to Graph on X and Y Axis
- Time Chart converted to a graph on Time Note: before transforming, you will need PY (|) followed by command, eg,
  ```spl
  index="_internal"
  index="_internal" | stats count by sourcetype
  index="_internal" | chart count by source
  index="_internal" | timechart count
  ```
### Step 4. Creating Dashboard
- Click Edit from the homepage
- Add Panel
- Select preferred Chart
- Copy and paste the Search History and click Add Dashboard

## Part 6: HANDLING DATA AND CONCEPTS OF BASIC FORWARDING
#### Splunk Forwarder is an agent installed on a server to capture or monitor certain files (log files)
- Data Input: What file to monitor
- Data Parsing: Converting Unstructured and Semi-structured data into a structured format.
- Data Indexing: Storing or ingeting data.
- Data Searching: Visualising Data

### Step 1. How to Install Splunk Forwarder
### Note: 
Install a universal Forwarder on another server and make sure the Splunk service is running. 
- In this case, follow Part 1, step 3 to step 4.
- Visit the Splunk webpage and click on Get My Free Download under Universal Forwarder
- Select Linux 64-bit, .deb, and copy the  link
 


### Step 1a. Commads
 ```bash
  sudo su
  cd /opt
  wget [forwarder link]
  dpkg -i splunkforwarder.deb
  cd splunkforwarder/bin
  ./splunk start --accept-license --answer-yes
  ```
  In case there is an error, run these commands:
  ```
  sudo systemctl daemon-reload
  sudo systemctl restart splunkforwarder. service
  ```
  ```
  ./restart.
  ```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7dfe5353-6ff9-4394-ac59-5f7cabe319c9)

### Step 2. Create/Configure Inputs:
Create an `inputs.conf` file to monitor the file (This will help Splunk to understand what file Splunk needs to monitor 
command:
```bash
cd /var/log
ls -la
cd /opt/splunkforwarder/etc/apps/search
ls -la
cd /opt/splunkforwarder/etc/apps/search/local create input in local
mkdir local
```
```bash
mkdir /opt/splunkforwarder/etc/apps/search/local
vi inputs.conf
[monitor:///var/log/syslog]
disabled = 0
index = splunkdemo2
```
 To edit, press i to `insert`, and to save `:wq enter`
  - Note: Create index name `Splunkdemo2`. Log in to Splunk as Admin, `Settings`, `New Index` and fill out form by giving it only a Name `Splunkdemo2` Save.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5e2dc11-e0f7-474c-90de-148c0d8e3e0b)

### Step 3. Create/Configure Outputs:
Create inputs.conf This will help Splunk to understand where to send data. now we have to tell our forwarder to send our capture data.
```bash
vi outputs.conf
[tcpout]
defaultGroup = my_indexers

[tcpout:my_indexers]
server = [Your-Splunk-IP]:9997
```

* Enable receiving on port `9997` in Splunk
* Restart forwarder: `./splunk restart`

Search with:

```spl
index="splunkdemo2"
```
To edit, press i to insert, and to save  `:wq enter`.
  - Note: `9997` is the port to communicate through; we must let Splunk receive from `port 9997`.
  - Go to Splunk Homepage, `Settings`, click on `Forwarding/receiving`, `New receiving port`, type `9997`, and click on save.
  - Restart Splunk service on both servers, and to do that, we have to change the Directory `cd /opt/splunkforwarder/bin/` and `./splunk restart`

## Part 7: SPLUNK INTEGRATION WITH AWS
### Step 1. Log in to Splunk 
- Go to splunk.com and log in
- Click on Products
- Free trials and Downloads
- Universal Forwarder
- click Download under `64 Bit Windows 10, 11, Server, 2022`

### Step 2. Create an Instance in the AWS S3 Buckets
Note: Authentication (AWS Access key / Secret key) Splunk needs `AWS Authentication key` to access `AWS logs/data`, so we have to enable some services in `AWS`.
- - Create `S3 Buckets`
  - Go to AWS console and log in
  - Under search type S3
  - Click on S3 (Scalable storage in the cloud)
  - Click create Bucket
  - -  Fill out the Following:
    -  Name: `kylebucket7958`
    -  Object Ownership: Default (ACLs Disabled)
    -  Block Public Access: uncheck `block all access` and check `I Acknowledge ...`
    -  Note: Leave the remaining of the setting and under the Bucket key check `Disable` and Scroll down and click `Create Bucket`.
    
 ### Step 3. Create Access and Secret Keys in AWS
 - Click on the `account name` in the top right corner
 - Go to `Security and Credentials`
 - Scroll down to Access Key and click on `Create Access Key` NOTE: If you already have one, use that `Key ID` and `Secret KEY`, but if no,t proceed to this process
 - Check `other`, click on Next
 - Leave `Description tag` Click `Create Access Key`
 - Copy both Key ID and Secret Key and save them `in Notepad` because we will need them later.
 - Download the CSV File and save.
   

### Step 4. Log in to Splunk
- Create a new `index` to capture data in Splunk (Refer to `Part 6` `Step 2` and Name it :`AWScap`)
- Go to `Apps`, click on `Find More Apps`, Search `aws`, click on `Install Aws Add-on on Spluck` to install, Click `Open App`.
- Under Login and Install. Use your Splunk log in credentials to log in, `Username` and `Password` then click `Agree` and Install
- After installing click on `Open the App`.


### Step 5. Add Account with AWS Credentials. That's the (Access Key)
- Click on `Configuration`.
- Click on `Add` (Make sure you are in the `Account tab`)
- - Name: `AWSaccount`
  - Key ID : `AKIA4SZHNXLLHWZYK478`
  - Secret Key: `Sbs3XaNsWr++r99mn4tb159yTHHCRZbnYZ8EIDDc`
  - Region `Globa` and click `ADD`.

### Step 6. Create New Inputs
- Click on `Inputs`
- `Custom Data Type`
- Generic S3 and fill out the Forms
- - AWS Name: `S3dataonboarding`
  - AWS Account: 'AWSaccount`
  - Leave, `Assume Role/Region/Use Private Endpoint`
  - S3 Bucket: `klyebucket7958`
  - Leave `Key Prefix`
  - Start Date/Time: `2024 Back date the Date`
  - End Date/Time:
  - Source Type: AWS:`S3`
  - Index: `AWScap` and Click on `ADD` to Add

### Step 7. Upload Any CSV File an S3 Bucket
- Open the `S3 bucket` in a different Browser
- Locate your S3 name: `kylebucket7958` Click on the name
- Click `Upload`
- Click `add file`
- Locate our CSV file used from the beginning of this Lab, select Add, and click on `Upload`
- - Note: Now Splunk will go to AWS and ask for data from the S3 Bucket because we created an input around that Splunk will ask AWS to share that data with.
  - So AWS will request an authentication key before allowing Spluck to access the data.
  - Then Spluck will give the Authentication key, which was provided in the cost of creating the account
  - And then Spluck will log into AWS to fetch the requested data 


### 8. Verify if the inputs have been created
- Go to `Apps` in Splunk
- Click on `Search/reporting`
- - Type: `indes=awscap` press enter
  - Click on Host: You will see the `host IP` under Values
  - Click on Source: Under Value, you will see `S3://kylebucket7958/csvfile`
  - Click on Source Type: you will see `AWS: S3`
